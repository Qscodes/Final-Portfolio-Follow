      <p>My name is Quintin Schomaker and I am currently enrolled
        in the communication and development master’s program at
        Ohio University. I am currently a teaching assistant for the
        Global Leadership Center (GLC), producing marketing content,
        facilitating courses, and helping organize the GLC agenda. For
        my undergraduate degree I studied integrated media, global
        leadership, and worked for Ohio University in its communication
        and marketing department (UCM). With a background in video
        production and design and a M.A. in communication and
        development my goal is to enhance organizations communication
        campaigns.</p>
      <p>I have experience working on a variety of different video projects.
        I have worked on documentaries, marketing, promotional,
        and scripted videos. My skills are very versatile within video
        production since I can shoot, edit, produce, and direct. My
        organizational, communicational, and creative skills not only
        make me a positive contributor to a video production team,
        but any team working towards a collective goal. Along with
        my video productions skills I have been fortunate enough
        to gain experiences in leadership and problem solving. The
        Global Leadership Program has given me opportunities
        to work with businesses and non-profits, both locally and
        internationally. I have travelled to Phnom Penh, Cambodia,
        Leipzig, Germany, and Accra, Ghana to work with students to
        provide consulting expertise for non-profit and a government
        agencies. Through these experiences I gained a skill set in cross
        cultural communication, international collaboration, and creative
        innovative problem solving. Visual storytelling, cross-cultural
        communication and problem solving are my passions.</p>

      <p>I am driven, passionate, and can adapt rapidly. I want to work in
        a creative professional environment where I can grow, learn, and
        create as a storyteller. Please consider me to be a new addition to
        your team. I look forward to hearing from you for the possibility
        of an interview.</P>
